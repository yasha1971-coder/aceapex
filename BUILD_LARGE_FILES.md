# Encoding and decoding large files with ACEAPEX

Two settings decide whether a multi-gigabyte file goes through or dies with an
out-of-memory kill. Both are ours, not the format's. This file records them so
nobody rediscovers them the hard way.

## 1. Do not force a small block size on large inputs

`ACEAPEX_BS` is a benchmark convention we use for small-corpus comparisons.
On a large file it is harmful: at 16 KB a 53.9 GB input becomes 3.3 million
blocks, each holding four allocations alive until concatenation.

Without the override, `compute_block_size()` picks 1 MB, giving 54 thousand
blocks - 64x fewer allocations. Measured on this machine (125 GB RAM):

| input | ACEAPEX_BS=16384 | default block size |
|-------|------------------|--------------------|
| 40 GiB | killed (OOM) | completed, RSS 117 GiB |
| 53.9 GB | killed | completed, RSS 118 GiB |

**Just do not set `ACEAPEX_BS` when encoding large files.**

## 2. Build the decoder without the analysis instrumentation

`aceapex_depth.cpp` doubles as the depth-analysis bench used to measure
MaxLevel for the papers. That instrumentation is fatal at scale:

- `g_record = true` appends every token to a vector (24 bytes each; ~4.4 billion
  tokens on a 53.9 GB output is over 100 GB)
- the depth block builds `tok_of`, one `uint32` per **output byte** (53.9 GB
  output would need 215 GB)
- `streams.bin` is dumped unconditionally
- `parallel_decode` is called with a hardcoded 1 thread

For a working decoder, change in your build copy:
g_record=true  -> g_record=false          // around the parallel_decode call
hdr.block_size,1)  ->  hdr.block_size,threads)
and delete the `streams.bin` dump block. Resident memory drops from 118 to
87.9 GiB on the 53.9 GB case, and decode runs on all threads.

## Verified results with these settings

## Reading the wall-clock numbers honestly

On this machine the array reads at 2.2 GB/s and writes at 819 MB/s. For the
53.9 GB decode that is 8.7 s reading the archive and 65.8 s writing the output,
against 14.3 s of actual decoding - storage is 72% of the wall time. Quoted
"MB/s wall" figures therefore measure the disk more than the codec.
