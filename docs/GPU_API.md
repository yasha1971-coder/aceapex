# GPU decoder: C ABI (`src/aceapex_gpu.h`)

Gate 5 of ROADMAP: a library other programs link, not only the measurement tool. Header `src/aceapex_gpu.h`
(C, `extern "C"`, the only CUDA type is `cudaStream_t`), implementation `src/aceapex_gpu_lib.cu`, host plan
`src/aceapex_gpu_plan.h` (plain C++), device kernels `src/aceapex_gpu_kernels.cuh` (shared with the tool
`aceapex_gpu.cu`). Example: `examples/gpu_decode.cu` (29 lines).

## Two phases

```c
/* 1. host, once per archive */
aceapex_gpu_plan* aceapex_gpu_plan_create(const void* h_archive, size_t in_bytes);
int     aceapex_gpu_last_error(void);
size_t  aceapex_gpu_temp_bytes(const aceapex_gpu_plan*);
size_t  aceapex_gpu_range_temp_bytes(const aceapex_gpu_plan*, uint64_t max_length);
size_t  aceapex_gpu_output_bytes(const aceapex_gpu_plan*);

/* 2. device, asynchronous, as often as needed */
int aceapex_gpu_decompress_async(const aceapex_gpu_plan*, const void* d_in,
                                 void* d_out, void* d_temp, int* d_status, unsigned flags, cudaStream_t);
int aceapex_gpu_decompress_range_async(const aceapex_gpu_plan*, const void* d_in,
                                       uint64_t offset, uint64_t length,
                                       void* d_out, void* d_temp, int* d_status, cudaStream_t);
void aceapex_gpu_plan_destroy(aceapex_gpu_plan*);
```

- `plan_create` reads a host copy of the whole archive: header, block table and every chunk table (the
  open DNA pack keeps a small header in each literal chunk, so "only the head" is not enough). It checks the
  framing (the checks of the CPU decoders), builds the job list and uploads it with the block table to the
  device - its only allocation and copy. It keeps no pointer into `h_archive`.
- The async calls launch kernels on `stream` and return. They make no allocation, no host-to-device copy of
  host memory and no synchronization: the job descriptors are copied from the plan into `d_temp` by a kernel
  that adds the addresses of `d_in` and `d_temp` ("fixup"). The return value reports host-side errors only
  (arguments, a launch failure); the result of the decode is `*d_status` once the stream gets there.
- A plan is read-only after creation. Several streams may decode with one plan at once, each with its own
  `d_temp`. One `d_temp` per call in flight.
- `d_in`: the archive bytes on the device, any alignment. `d_temp`: `temp_bytes` (range:
  `range_temp_bytes(max_length)`), 256-byte aligned. `d_out`: `output_bytes`, or `length` for a range.

## Range decode

`decompress_range_async(offset, length)` decodes only the blocks covering `[offset, offset+length)` and, in
each stream, only the chunks those blocks use: on the host, from the plan, it picks a contiguous index range
of every job array (all of them are ordered by stream and chunk) - O(log n), no device transfer - then
launches the same kernels on those ranges, decodes the blocks into a window after the temp layout and copies
the requested bytes into `d_out`. nvCOMP has no equivalent: it decodes whole frames.

## Fail-closed

- Framing errors (header, block table, chunk tables, open-pack headers): `plan_create` returns NULL,
  `aceapex_gpu_last_error()` = `ACEAPEX_GPU_E_ARCHIVE`.
- Content errors found on the device set bits of `*d_status`: `ACEAPEX_GPU_STATUS_PIECE` (a rANS chunk or
  piece, spec 3.1.1), `_OPEN` (an open DNA pack, spec 3.4), `_ZSTD` (a frame failed or decoded to another
  size), `_MATCH` (a block's tokens did not decode to exactly its size). The call does not crash and does
  not read or write outside its buffers (plan limits; CPU judge below, also under ASan/UBSan).
- Flag `ACEAPEX_GPU_VERIFY_XXH3` (full decode): the device computes XXH3_64bits of the output and compares it
  with the archive header; a difference sets `ACEAPEX_GPU_STATUS_HASH`. This is what catches bytes stored raw
  in the archive (literal runs, raw pieces, zstd raw blocks), which carry no check of their own: on the
  Blackwell run 74fc806 the zstd profile decoded 20 of 20 byte flips to wrong bytes with status 0 without it.
  XXH3's long path adds stripe terms per 1 KiB block and scrambles the 8 accumulators after each block; the
  additions do not depend on the accumulators, so the block terms are computed in parallel and only the
  scramble chain (one step per KiB, 8 lanes) runs sequentially (`src/ax_xxh3.h`, judged on the CPU against
  `XXH3_64bits`: claim `head_gpu_xxh3_emu`). A range decode cannot be checked this way: the hash covers the
  whole original.

## Profiles and nvCOMP

The open profile (`AX_PROFILE=open`: rANS tokens, open literal chunks) needs nothing but CUDA. The default
and rANS-token profiles contain zstd frames; they need the library built with `-DACEAPEX_GPU_NVCOMP` and
nvCOMP 5 (`-l:libnvcomp.so.5`), otherwise `plan_create` returns NULL with `ACEAPEX_GPU_E_NVCOMP`.
Match kernel: v7-RA with 32 lanes per block (the value the tool's probe picked on T4, L4, A100 and the
Blackwell); grid from the occupancy of the current device at `plan_create`.

## Build

```sh
nvcc -std=c++17 -O3 -arch=sm_XX -Isrc -c src/aceapex_gpu_lib.cu                          # open profile only
nvcc -std=c++17 -O3 -arch=sm_XX -Isrc -DACEAPEX_GPU_NVCOMP -I<nvcomp>/include -c src/aceapex_gpu_lib.cu
nvcc -std=c++17 -O3 -arch=sm_XX -Isrc examples/gpu_decode.cu src/aceapex_gpu_lib.cu -o gpu_decode
```

## Checks

- Without a GPU (judge, claim `head_gpu_plan_emu`): `scripts/gpu_plan_emu.cpp` builds the plan and executes
  it job by job on the CPU in the order the library launches the device (raw copies, zstd frames, rANS pieces,
  both DNA unpacks, the match kernel with one lane) into a temp buffer with the plan's layout: 33 archives
  (conformance fixtures, chr1 slice, four profiles encoded on the spot) bit-perfect; 1 320 random ranges on a
  zeroed temp with only the selected jobs (a job the selection misses shows up as zeros); 1 980 one-byte
  mutations refused by the planner or run inside their buffers (also under ASan/UBSan).
- With a GPU (`scripts/colab_gpu_open.sh`, program `scripts/gpu_api_test.cu`): full decode bit-perfect and
  timed against the measurement tool on the same archive, the same with the XXH3 check (its cost), random windows 1 B .. 1 MiB against the original,
  single-byte flips of the device copy (caught / silent / harmless counts, no CUDA error), the example on the
  open archive built without nvCOMP.

## Numbers

Only measured figures go here, with the log they come from. The measurement tool on the RTX PRO 6000
Blackwell (`results/colab-2026-09-30-rtx-pro-6000-blackwell-27b61b1.log`, on-device, median of 3): chr1
open profile 2.826 ms against 3.501 ms for the zstd profile through nvCOMP (x1.24), T2T 27.135 against
35.542 ms (x1.31). The library, same GPU, chr1 (`results/colab-2026-09-30-rtx-pro-6000-blackwell-74fc806-gpu-capi.log`,
on-device, median of 3): open profile 2.474 ms (the tool 2.829 ms on the same archive), zstd profile 3.358 ms
(3.518 ms); 200 of 200 random windows equal to the original, 16 KiB window 0.691 ms (open) / 1.126 ms (zstd).
Cost of the XXH3 check, first version (`results/colab-2026-10-01-rtx-pro-6000-blackwell-f2e16b7-xxh3.log`): +9.970 ms on
chr1 zstd (3.297 -> 13.267 ms), +9.850 ms on chr1 open; byte flips caught 20 of 20 on both profiles with the check
(zstd: 0 of 20 without it). Second version (key table, 64-bit loads, chain prefetch 32 blocks ahead): pending.
