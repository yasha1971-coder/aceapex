# Repository guide

This is an active research repository, not a packaged product. The root holds
a working researcher's files — final code, experiment probes, design notes, and
figures — side by side. This guide is the map so you can find what you need
without reading every filename.

## If you are here to...

**...understand what ACEAPEX is** → read `README.md`. It has the papers, the
honest-status section (what is and is not fast), and the core idea.

**...cite this work** → use the "Cite this repository" button (GitHub reads
`CITATION.cff`), or cite the papers directly:
- Paper 1 — arXiv:2606.04268 (the codec, CPU scaling, GPU wavefront)
- Paper 2 — arXiv:2606.18900 (device-resident pipeline, 50 GB genome seek)
- Paper 3 — arXiv:2606.24531 (unified two-layer position-invariant seek)
- Paper 4 — arXiv:2607.18541 (what governs decode throughput; the min-match lever)

**...reproduce the numbers** → the build recipes and run steps are in the
`BUILD_*.md` files and `TECHNICAL_NOTE.txt`. `setup_pod.sh` bootstraps a fresh
GPU pod to a verified environment. `BUILD_LARGE_FILES.md` covers the two settings
that decide whether a large file encodes at all.

**...read the production codec** → `src/` holds the maintained CPU code; the
same code, kept in sync, is the `aceapex 1.0.1` entry in the official lzbench
benchmark.

**...run the GPU decoder** → the `.cu` files (`e2e_pipe_tile.cu`, `dense.cu`,
`e2e_seek.cu`, `full_gpu_decode_*.cu`) are the device-resident paths; build
commands are in each file's header and in the `BUILD_*.md` notes.

## The research archive (kept on purpose)

The `.txt` studies and design `.md` files in the root are the research record.
They are not dead weight — they document what was tried, what worked, and what
did **not**, so the findings can be re-derived and the mistakes are not repeated.
A few worth knowing about:

- `BREAKTHROUGH_PROBES.txt` — probes toward the open throughput ceiling.
- `CAUSAL_STRUCTURE_REWRITING.md` — the encoder-side chain-flattening idea that
  exploits ACEAPEX's absolute offsets (a property unique to this format).
- `FASTQ_PREPROCESSING_STUDY.txt` — why input data must be inspected by eye; the
  record of a degenerate-quality sample that once inflated a ratio and was caught
  and corrected. Kept so the same data trap is never walked into again.
- `PAPER*_MEASUREMENTS.txt`, `RESULTS_*.txt` — the measured numbers behind the
  papers, with datasets and hashes.
- `d2p_dense_*` — the D1-dense two-kernel decoder (a throughput improvement over
  the fused path).

## Why one repository, not many

The code, the notes, and the results are kept together on purpose: it keeps the
work reproducible and reviewable from one place. The layout is a working desk,
not a shipped package — treat the root as a lab notebook with the finished tools
mixed in, and use this guide as the index.
